The main goal of the project is to create a tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria. This tool can be used by individuals to assess the security of their passwords and ensure they are using strong and robust passwords for their accounts.

How it works:

1. The check_password_strength function takes a password as input and checks its strength based on length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character), and commonality (against a list of common passwords).
2. If the password fails any of these criteria, it is considered weak; otherwise, it is considered strong.
3. The program prompts the user to enter a password and then uses the check_password_strength function to evaluate its strength.
